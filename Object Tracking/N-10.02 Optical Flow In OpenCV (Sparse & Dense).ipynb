    "Lucas-Kanade method computes optical flow for a sparse feature set (which we used as corners). OpenCV provides another algorithm to find dense optical flow. It computes the optical flow for all the points in the frame. It is based on **Gunner Farneback's** algorithm which is explained in [**`Two-Frame Motion Estimation Based on Polynomial Expansion\" by Gunner Farneback in 2003.`**](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:273847/FULLTEXT01.pdf)\n",

    "Below python script shows how to find the dense optical flow using Gunner's algorithm. We get a 2-channel array with optical flow vectors, (u,v) using the function **cv2.calcOpticalFlowFarneback()**. We then find their magnitude and direction. We color code the result for better visualization. Direction corresponds to Hue value of the image. Magnitude corresponds to Value plane. Saturation is kept maximum (255) for maximizing visibility.\n",

    "- **`pyr_scale`**\tparameter, specifying the image scale (<1) to build pyramids for each image; pyr_scale=0.5 means a classical pyramid, where each next layer is twice smaller than the previous one.\n",
    "- **`levels`**\tnumber of pyramid layers including the initial image; levels=1 means that no extra layers are created and only the original images are used.\n",
    "- **`winsize`**\taveraging window size; larger values increase the algorithm robustness to image noise and give more chances for fast motion detection, but yield more blurred motion field.\n",
    "iterations\tnumber of iterations the algorithm does at each pyramid level.\n",
    "- **`poly_n`**\tsize of the pixel neighborhood used to find polynomial expansion in each pixel; larger values mean that the image will be approximated with smoother surfaces, yielding more robust algorithm and more blurred motion field, typically poly_n =5 or 7.\n",
    "- **`poly_sigma`**\tstandard deviation of the Gaussian that is used to smooth derivatives used as a basis for the polynomial expansion; for poly_n=5, you can set poly_sigma=1.1, for poly_n=7, a good value would be poly_sigma=1.5.\n",

    "  2. **OPTFLOW_FARNEBACK_GAUSSIAN** uses the Gaussian winsize×winsize filter instead of a box filter of the same size for optical flow estimation; usually, this option gives z more accurate flow than with a box filter, at the cost of lower speed; normally, winsize for a Gaussian window should be set to a larger value to achieve the same level of robustness.\n"
